        <h2 id="welcome-">Welcome !</h2><p>This website is a little personal project of web development. Even if it isn‚Äôt really part of my curriculum, a little bit of practice can‚Äôt hurt.
I‚Äôm currently studying at ESIREM in France to get a degree in security and quality of networks (year 4 out of 5). My subjects of interest in this field are cybersecurity (I‚Äôm hosting at Tor relay <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/A7572A5090591E3D7E8027F34F5DF05756EFFE89">@section9lair.tk</a>) and immutable and reproducible network and backend environments (I‚Äôve spent too much time gathering scattered config files and fixing config quirks and migrating websites and services while I‚Äôm only a student). So, yes, DevOps interests me a lot. I use <a href="https://nixos.org">NixOS</a> as my operating system for servers and <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a> to manage specific apps.</p><h2 id="what-about-this-website-">What about this website ?</h2><p>The website in itself being a challenge, I‚Äôve brought some rules and objectives :</p><ul>
<li><strong>No client side rendering.</strong></li>
</ul><p>Imagine not finding this website when searching my name online or having it loading for 30 plus seconds. As SSR is mandatory, I have to choose between dynamic page builders like SvelteKit or Next.js, or static sites generators, exit vanilla Svelte or React.</p><ul>
<li><strong>One new technology learnt minimum</strong></li>
</ul><p>The word ‚Äútechnology‚Äù is a bit vague, but let‚Äôs say that replacing Rollup by Snowpack to bundle my javascript doesn‚Äôt count. the technology has to impact the code I‚Äôm producing.</p><p>These specifications are not heavy, but it‚Äôs ok I‚Äôm having fun, I‚Äôm not doing this project under pressure I swear.</p><p>to do a brief history of this project, I did build a first version with <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a>, because I liked Svelte, but I quickly dropped this idea for a simple reason :</p><ul>
<li><strong>Why would I need a backend ?</strong> I mean, the few pages generated for my site could easily be rendered statically, right ? Moreover, a NodeJS server consumes more power than a mere Apache or NGINX server, and it‚Äôs a bit less convenient to host than static webpages.</li>
</ul><p>I quickly went back on track after discovering <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>, a static website generator allowing use of components from different frameworks at the same time (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc‚Ä¶). I built the website you‚Äôre seeing using Astro and svelte components, but what is it worth ? Well numbers don‚Äôt lie and you can open <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#devtools">Chrome lighthouse</a> if you‚Äôre on a chromium based website.</p><p>A few side notes : I use <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind css</a> for styling, I‚Äôve discovered it during the project and it‚Äôs neat ! Also the website is hosted using github pages and it has an Github Action on each commit on the main branch to build it.</p><p>My tech-stack for this project is <strong>AST</strong> :</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A</strong> stro</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>S</strong> velte</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>T</strong> ailwind CSS</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Only the <strong>R</strong> and the <strong>O</strong> are missing to complete my recursive acronym and win the Web development game (The best tech stack name always wins).
<strong>R</strong> for Redis maybe ü§î? Still have no clue for the O. It‚Äôs a hobby project anyway, I can extend it how I want.</p><h2 id="faq">F.A.Q</h2><p>I‚Äôve imagined a few annoying questions, here goes nothing.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>How much time spent to make this website</strong> 20 hours maybe ? I made it in 4 days after my quarantine in Korea, it took me a bit of time to learn Tailwind, make the Github CI work and fill all of these pages (still haven‚Äôt finished though).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A lot of technologies are mentionned, which ones are mastered ?</strong> Well, not React, sincerely sorry. I should have done this project using a React framework seing how much it is important in frontend WebDev nowadays but I sinned out of laziness and Svelte is just too comfortable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I can‚Äôt see PHP mentionned anywhere on this page, do you by any chance ‚Ä¶</strong> A HA, well, ehm‚Ä¶ sorry but I can‚Äôt talk about it, too many memories, too much emotion.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Sup‚Äô <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/clement-ballot">@Cl√©ment Ballot</a>, one day i‚Äôll remake this website using Processing.</p>
